# WebScrapper
Webscrapper to get public company information and bypass captchas.

This product was delivered to a client to allow them to get company information from their local government site. 
Due to the immense amount of captchas, this task would easily take hours without help.

This script allowed my client to successfully gather the public company information from this website and save it in an Excel file.
